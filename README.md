OBJECTIVE: 

Build a Loan Approval Prediction Model using Jupyter Notebook. Use machine learning techniques to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various factors such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history

SUMMARY

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale the features.

Model Training: We used Random Forest Classifier, but you can also experiment with other models.

Evaluation: Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional): GridSearchCV to fine-tune model hyperparameters.

Save the Model: Save the trained model using joblib.
